Exercises on algorithms

**SSvsBS.py** - Python implementation of both linear and binary search algorithms with runtime comparison

**Search.java** - Java implementation of both linear and binary search algorithms with runtime comparison

**selectionSort.py** - Python implementation of selection sort algo

**qsort.py** - Python implementation of Quicksort with pivot as the middle element in each subarray

**rsum.py** - recursive function to sum up all elements of a list

**rlen.py** - recursive function to return the lenght of a list

**bfs.py** - implementation of Breadth-First Search using python dictionary to model connections in a directed graph

**dijk.py** - Dijkstra's pathfinding in Python, using dictionaries

**UnionFind** - a set of algorithms for **Dynamic Connectivity Problem**, in Java; Quick Find, Quick Union, and QU improvements

**DynamicConnectivity** - added new algorithm for **Dynamic Connectivity Problem** - Quick Union; added basic inheritance for convenience; from now on _this_ folder will be updated

**JS algorithm for string permutation** - no duplicates in the output array. E.g. perm. of "ABCD" has 24 elements (4!) and perm. of "ABCC" has only 12 (4! / 2)
